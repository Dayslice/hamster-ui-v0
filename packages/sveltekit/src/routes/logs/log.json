They have a strong presence on the first page of search results for these keywords, with only a few competitors ranking higher.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement in other areas, such as \"advisory shares\" and \"what are advisory shares\". Carta.com ranks lower for these keywords compared to their competitors. It may be worthwhile for Carta.com to focus on improving their content and optimization strategies for these keywords in order to increase their visibility in search results and drive more traffic to their site.\n\nBased on the data, here are some recommended long-tail keywords that Carta.com could optimize for:\n\n1. Stock options for startups\n2. Vesting schedule for equity\n3. What is an 83b election\n4. Advisory shares vs common shares\n5. Understanding 409a valuation\n6. Cap table management software\n7.

{"type": "chat", "speaker": "Kevin | Head of Marketing", "receiver": null, "content": "Alicia, your thorough analysis is much appreciated. I notice that 'carta support phone number' is suggested as a keyword due to its high search volume and low difficulty. This is interesting, but I'm wondering if we should consider the user intent behind such a search. Do you think optimizing for a customer support-related keyword could dilute our content strategy focused on our expertise and services?", "timestamp": "2023-09-29T14:37:44Z", "attachments": []},
{"type": "chat", "speaker": "Alicia | SEO Expert", "receiver": null, "content": "You bring up a valid point, Kevin. While 'carta support phone number' does have high search volume and low difficulty, optimizing for this keyword could indeed dilute our content strategy if not done carefully. We should remember that while optimizing for keywords, user intent behind the search is crucial. In this case, people searching for 'carta support phone number' are likely looking for customer service, not necessarily our services or expertise. However, it could still be a potential touchpoint for brand visibility and customer engagement. Given your feedback, I propose we revise our keyword strategy. We can still include 'carta support phone number' in our SEO strategy but perhaps in a more supportive role, such as including it in the contact page or footer, rather than a central keyword in our content strategy. Instead, we should focus more on keywords directly related to our services and expertise, such as 'secondary shares', '4 year vesting' and 'stock options for startups'.", "timestamp": "2023-09-29T14:37:44Z", "attachments": []},

{"type": "chat", "speaker": "Alicia | SEO Expert", "receiver": null, "content": "Kevin, you raise a valid concern around 'carta private markets' and 'carta stock certificates'. These keywords are indeed specific to our brand, but they also have a lower difficulty and higher chance of ranking.

However, I agree that we should also consider more generic terms related to our industry and services, to attract a broader audience. In light of your feedback, I propose we maintain 'carta private markets' and 'carta stock certificates' as part of our long-tail keyword strategy, but also add more generic terms such as 'equity management', 'private company stock', and 'startup financing'.
