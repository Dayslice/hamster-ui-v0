{"type": "chat", "speaker": "Kevin | Head of Marketing", "receiver": null, "content": "Alicia, I see you've identified quite a few target keywords for Carta.com. Have you considered the user intent behind these keywords and how well our current content aligns with this intent? If not, could this be an important factor to consider in our SEO strategy?", "timestamp": "2023-09-28T17:24:09Z", "attachments": []}
{"type": "chat", "speaker": "Alicia | SEO Expert", "receiver": null, "content": "Absolutely, Kevin. User intent is a critical consideration when it comes to SEO strategy. All the keywords I've identified are based on the assumption that our content can satisfy the intent behind these search queries. For example, the question-based keywords like 'Can I sell shares in my company?' or 'What is a 1099 b?' imply that the user is looking for specific information or a solution to a problem. If our content can provide that, we stand a good chance of ranking high for these keywords. We should conduct a content audit to ensure that our current content aligns with the user intent behind these target keywords. If necessary, we might need to create new content or update existing content to better match the search intent. This not only helps us rank higher but also ensures we provide value to our users, improving our reputation and user engagement.", "timestamp": "2023-09-28T17:24:09Z", "attachments": []}
{"type": "chat", "speaker": "Alicia | SEO Expert", "receiver": null, "content": "There are two main reasons why it's important to consider user intent in our SEO strategy. First, search engines like Google have gotten very good at understanding user intent, and they reward sites that satisfy this intent with higher rankings. Second, even if we rank high for a keyword but our content doesn't match the user's intent, they'll likely bounce off our page, which can negatively impact our SEO.", "timestamp": "2023-09-28T17:24:09Z", "attachments": []}

{"type": "chat", "speaker": "Alicia | SEO Expert", "receiver": null, "content": "Absolutely, Kevin. While these long-tail and question-based keywords have lower competition and may rank higher, we have indeed considered their conversion potential. These keywords are highly specific and are more likely to attract users who are actually interested in our services, increasing the chances of conversion. However, it's vital to not only rely on intuition but to continuously monitor and analyse the performance of these keywords. If we notice that they are not leading to conversions, we can always adjust our strategy accordingly. In addition to conducting a content audit and updating our content to align with the user intent of our target keywords, I propose conducting a thorough keyword performance analysis. This will allow us to monitor the conversion rates of our keywords and adjust our SEO strategy as necessary. We should also consider conducting A/B testing to understand which keywords result in the highest conversion rates.", "timestamp": "2023-09-28T17:24:09Z", "attachments": []}

{"type": "chat", "speaker": "Alicia | SEO Expert", "receiver": null, "content": "You're absolutely right, Kevin. Evaluating keywords based solely on their search volumes and competitiveness is not enough.

Keywords that are highly relevant to our target audience's search intent are more likely to result in conversions.
